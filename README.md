- 👋 Hi, I’m Vaughn.
- 👀 I’m interested in systems interactions and control. I do a little bit of everything.
- 🌱 I studied mechanical engineering at Wichita State University, worked as a machinist, drafter, and now engineering (manufacturing processes). I do a lot of statistics and research into manufacturing technologies for high performance electrical connectors.
- 💞️ I like robots, 3d printers, and JIT learning->engineering->manufacturing.
Basically I like to make computers do my bidding.
